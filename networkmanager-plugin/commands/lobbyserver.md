# LobbyServer

## Configuration

1. Go to the settings in the NetworkManager panel.
2. Change the setting \`command\_lobbyserver\_server\` to your lobbyserver name or lobbies group name \(incase you use the servermanager module\).
3. If you want to change the command\(s\) you can do that by changing \`command\_lobbyserver\` in the settings.
4. Enable the command. You can enable the command by switching the \`command\_lobbyserver\_enabled\` setting on.

NOTE: this does not require any permission so anyone will be able to use it while it is enabled.
