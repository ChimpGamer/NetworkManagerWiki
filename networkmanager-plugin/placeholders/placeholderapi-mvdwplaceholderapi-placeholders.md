# PlaceholderAPI

### Requirements

1. The [NetworkManager](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/networkmanager.28456/) plugin installed and configured on your spigot server.
2. Make sure you have [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) installed on your spigot server.
3. The latest version of the networkmanager placeholder expansion. You can download it with "/papi ecloud download NetworkManager".

### Placeholders

NOTE: PlaceholderAPI placeholders start and end with % like %networkmanager_players%. \


All internal networkmanager placeholders work in placeholderapi. You just have to add networkmanager\_ before the first %. Like internal the placeholder %playtime% becomes %networkmanager_playtime% when using it in placeholderapi.\
