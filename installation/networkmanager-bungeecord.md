![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

### Requirements

1. Make sure you have Java 8 installed!â€‹
2. BungeeCord Server that is configured.
3. MySQL Server with a database and a user account. \(If your MySQL Server is on a other server then your Web Server you need to allow remote connections on your MySQL Server.\) \(MariaDB 10 Recommended \(MariaDB is a fork of MySQL\)\).

### Installation

1. Drop the plugin \(NetworkManager\) in your BungeeCord plugins folder.
2. Start your BungeeCord server.
3. Open the settings.yml located at /plugins/NetworkManager/settings.yml.
4. Enter your MySQL host, port, username, password and database.
5. \(Optional\) Enable Redis. Enter redis host and password if you set one.
6. Restart your BungeeCord server. It will now create tables and insert some data into it.
7. Execute "nm test database" in the console to test the connection. If the command is unknown check your bungeecord log.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Don't join the server yet! After you installed the WebInterface go to the Settings and search for servermode. Make sure you've set the correct servermode.   
  
You can choose: ONLINE, OFFLINE or MIXED.
{% endhint %}

```

### Common issues

1. If you see something like this: "Could not create connection to database server. Attempted reconnect 3 times. Giving up." it means it couldn't connect to your MySQL database. Check in the setting.yml if you have set the correct settings.
