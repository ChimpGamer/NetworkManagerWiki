# \(Important\) GeoIP Api Access Key

NetworkManager uses a third party service to get the country code of a player. This service is free to use \(with limitations\) but requires an API Key. You can get yourself a free key here: [https://ipapi.com/product](https://ipapi.com/product). Once you got a key you go to the Plugin Settings in the Web Interface and look for the settings 'setting\_geoip\_api\_accesskey' and fill in the API Key. It can take up to 2 minutes until the setting will be applied.
