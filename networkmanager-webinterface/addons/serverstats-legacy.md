# serverStats-Legacy

## Requirements

1. Your Web Interface needs to be installed and configured.

### Installation

1. You'll need to download the latest version of Addon. Once downloaded unzip the file and upload the content of the ZIP into your web directory. (example: /var/www/html/addons).
2. Now go to the addons folder. open serverStats-legacy and then open the dep folder. There you will see the servers.txt file. Give the file write permissions (766 should be enough).
3. Then go to the web interface (you might need to refresh the page) and click on the addon. Then click Refresh and wait until it is done with updating. This can take a while.
