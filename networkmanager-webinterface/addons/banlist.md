{% endhint %}

## How to install it?

1. Ensure you have set 'inc/classes/config.php' to permissions 777.
2. Now configure the BanList. Navigate to something like: 'http://YOUR\_IP\_OR\_DOMAIN/your\_path/install.php'.
3. Follow the instructions on the screen. You need your MySQL details (Same as the plugin) and ensure you have set 'inc/classes/config.php' to permissions 777 before clicking Install Now! (Its recommended to set this back to 644 once you are done).
4. That should be it! Now you can start using it!
