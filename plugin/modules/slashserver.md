# SlashServer

SlashServer creates commands with the name of the server.  
Example: You have a server called survival and skyblock. SlashServer allows you to do /survival and /skyblock to switch to these servers.

### Configuration

1. Enable the slashserver module \(module\_slashserver\) in the settings.
2. Assign the permission networkmanager.slashserver.&lt;servername&gt; or networkmanager.slashserver.\* \(for all servers\) to a permission group or player.
3. You should now be able to use commands like /survival, /skyblock, etc. Depending on your servernames.
