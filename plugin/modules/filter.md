# Filter

The Filter module uses regex. Even if you don't apply it it will be used internal to find the matching word.

With regex you can make efficient rules to Filter words or sentences. For example:

```text
\b(v(\W|\d|_)*a(\W|\d|_)*g(\W|\d|_)*i(\W|\d|_)*n(\W|\d|_)*a(\W|\d|_)*) # This will block vagina is a few ways.
```

You can test your regex expressions at an online website like: [https://regexr.com/](https://regexr.com/)
